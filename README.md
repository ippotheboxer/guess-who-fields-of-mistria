Welcome to this Fields of Mistria inspired 'Guess Who?' game!

## How to play

![preview_vid](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4a3210-634e-40c8-9164-1991b4771276)

The idea is that two people play on seperate screens. Pick the character you want the other person to guess! You can do this by chosing the chosen character at the bottom of the screen - you can pick whichever one you want, or just select randomly!
There are some filters to help with the game:
- female (cancels out the female characters)
- male (cancels out the male characters)
- romanceable (cancels out the dateable characters)
- reset (resets all characters selected, and the chosen character)

There are also some seasonal filters at the top - spring, summer, fall and winter. This changes the seasonal outfits.

⭐ Accurate to current version (created April 2025) ⭐

## Data

I got the data from this json and image data [repo](https://github.com/ippotheboxer/fields-of-mistria-characters) I made - feel free to also use it if you want to code something mistria-related!

## Credits

I got everything: character images, icons off of the [wiki.gg](https://fieldsofmistria.wiki.gg/) for Mistria.

Inspired by the official Guess Who? game.
